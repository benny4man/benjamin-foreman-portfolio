          Hi, my name is Benjamin Foreman. I am a Computer Science student who
          is passionate about web and software development. I grew up in the
          Metro-Detroit area and have always had a love for computers. For fun
          I would build PCs and tinker with programs. When I started
          my college career I decided to translate this hobby into my love for
          coding.

          Currently I am an IT online chat consultant for the University of
          Michigan. Previously I worked as a Merchandising Associate for Kohl's
          and as a Tutor for Oakland University. From my classes I have found
          that I like software and web developement so in the future I would
          like to be a Software Engineer or a Frontend Web Developer. To learn
          more about me check out my
