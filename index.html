            Hi, my name is Benjamin Foreman. I am a Comupter Science student who
            is passionate about web and software development. I grew up in the
            metro-Detroit area and have always had a love for computers. For fun
            I would like to build PCs and tinker with programs. When I started
            my college career I decided to translate this hobby into my love for
            coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I am an IT online chat consultant for the University of
            Michigan. Previously I worked as Merchandising Associate for Kohl's
            and as a Tutor for Oakland University. From my classes I have found
            that I like software and web developement so in the future I would
            like to be a Software Engineer or a Frontend Web Developer. To learn
            more about me check out my
